# Conway's Game of Life: Toroidal Edition

This project is an advanced implementation of Conway's Game of Life, featuring a toroidal grid, entropy visualization, and 3D representation. It's built using Next.js, React Three Fiber, and TypeScript.

## Features

- 2D Game of Life simulation on a toroidal grid
- 3D visualization of the game state on a torus
- Real-time entropy calculations and visualization
- Customizable grid size, cell size, and simulation speed
- Initial configuration tool with preset patterns
- Pattern recognition for common structures (e.g., gliders, blinkers)
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
